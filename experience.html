        <h3>Software Development & Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          I have comfortable experience with Python and R, primarily using them for data analysis, visualization, and basic scripting. While I am not an expert, I can work with these tools to process and interpret data effectively. My strongest experience lies in GIS and spatial analysis, where I have worked extensively with ArcGIS and QGIS to analyze geospatial data, create maps, and extract meaningful insights. My ability to integrate data visualization with GIS enhances my approach to presenting complex spatial information in a clear and impactful way.

        <h3>Web Development & Frontend Skills</h3>
        <p>
          I have a growing proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am actively developing my skills in frontend web development. Through coursework and projects, I have built interactive web pages, worked with DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, and explored ways to enhance user experience. While I am still honing my expertise, I am eager to expand my knowledge in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, with a goal of transitioning into a more frontend-focused role that blends creativity with technical problem-solving.
